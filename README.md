This is a simple web-application used to handle basic inventory management operations. jQuery, JavaScript and Nodejs are used. Nodejs was used to facilitate a server using the express library. In addition to this, neDB is used to create databases, mainly the inventory and users database. jQuery is used to load webpages dynamically.

To use, make sure you have Nodejs installed and follow these instructions.

    Navigate to the directory where the project is stored.
    Open a CLI such as Terminal.
    Run "npm init" and follow the instructions.
    Run "npm install express".
    Run node index_server.js

*Now the server should be running, and a "Listening to port 3000!" should be displayed. Navigate to a browser and go on http://localhost:3000/.

** You can use Username: admin and password: admin to get going or just make a new account!
